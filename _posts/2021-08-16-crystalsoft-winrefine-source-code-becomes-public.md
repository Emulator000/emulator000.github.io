## WinRefine

WinRefine was a very popular software for Windows in 2009-2014 years, and today, I'm happy to share the source code since the application got now deprecated and not more "officially" downloadable from the new CrystalSoft [website](https://www.crystalsoft.it/).

Mentioning [Softpedia](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/System-Tweak/WinRefine.shtml):
> Intuitive system tweak program that helps you preview files (images and videos) and play audio items in the background as soon as you hover your mouse over a target file

### Source Code

You can download the latest source code from 2010 directly from the [CrystalSoft](https://github.com/CrystalSoft) official repository:
- [https://github.com/CrystalSoft/winrefine](https://github.com/CrystalSoft/winrefine)
- [https://github.com/CrystalSoft/winrefine-view](https://github.com/CrystalSoft/winrefine-view)

The application is made in two parts, one is the main DLL `WinRefine.dll` and the second one is the view `WinRefine.exe`.


### Download old WinRefine releases

You can also download the installer and standalone old WinRefine from [here](https://github.com/CrystalSoft/winrefine/releases).
